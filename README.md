Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to perform customer segmentation
using the K-Means clustering algorithm in order to better understand the
different types of customers in a given dataset.
Dataset: You will be working with the 'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset, which can
be found at the following link:
https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA06/Mall_Customers.csv

The dataset contains the following attributes:
1. CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer
2. Gender: Male or Female
3. Age: Age of the customer
4. Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
5. Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer
behavior and spending nature (higher scores indicate higher spending)

Tasks:
1. Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): a. Import the
necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) b. Load the dataset
using pandas and display the first few rows c. Check for missing values and
handle them appropriately d. Visualize the distribution of features using
histograms or boxplots
2. Prepare the data for clustering: a. Perform any necessary feature scaling
(StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) b. Choose the appropriate features for
clustering (you may start with 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score') c. Create a
new DataFrame with only the selected features
3. Implement k-means clustering: a. Import the KMeans class from the
sklearn.cluster module b. Use the Silhouette Method to determine the optimal
number of clusters c. Train the KMeans model with the optimal number of
clusters d. Obtain the cluster assignments for each data point
4. Visualize and analyze the clusters: a. Create a scatter plot of the selected features,
colored by cluster assignment b. Interpret the clusters and provide a brief
description of each cluster c. (Optional) Perform the same analysis with different
sets of features and compare the results
5. Write a report summarizing your findings: a. Describe the dataset and its
attributes b. Detail the steps taken for data preprocessing, feature selection, and
scaling c. Explain the process of determining the optimal number of clusters d.
Describe the clusters and their characteristics e. Discuss any insights or
recommendations based on your analysis
